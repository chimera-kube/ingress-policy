  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    Restrict ingress resources
    The policy configuration allows to set several properties:
      * `requireTLS` - `boolean`: whether the `spec` for ingresses resources has to include a `tls` attribute that include all hosts defined in the `.spec.rules` attribute of the ingress resource. If any of the hosts defined in `.spec.rules` is not listed inside `spec.tls` the policy will reject the ingress resource.
      * `allowPorts` - `[<int>]`: list of allowed ports inside `.spec.rules.paths.backend.service.port`. If this array contains at least one port, any other port will be rejected.
      * `denyPorts` - `[<int>]`: list of denied ports inside `.spec.rules.paths.backend.service.port`. If any port matches a port on this array, the ingress resource will be rejected, otherwise it will be accepted.

    If `allowPorts` and `denyPorts` are provided together (and are not empty), `denyPorts` is prioritized.
